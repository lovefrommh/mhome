        <h3>Roadmap of Mamring Homestay</h3>
        <p>The Northern region was already dominated by the home stay industry, many hilly region were already popularised with the same. The Mamring Khasmahal in Sittong remained virgin till 22nd March, 2022 when we builded the first homestay under the ownership  of Philamon Mukhia. Under the guidance of Aasnik Home's and Host Anju Kc Mukhia, we were able to introduce our homestay to the foreign travellers. <br>
        Our first guest, "Amitabh Sharma" with his loving family visited our homestay on "30th May 2022", we shared a loving memories with them and they encouraged us to serve better. For a year, we had a special chef Amit Mukhia, He receieved many good feedback from our guests but sadly, he discontinued the services and so our host stepped in as a chef since last year, With much more positive feedback from our guest we continued our host to cook delicious food. Our owner Philamon Mukhia is blessed to have the best host and cook for his homestay. She is polite and good communicator with guests. <br>
        Challanges - The construction was completed but some of the details were still pending due to budget crises and low credits. Our neighbours and family supported us with many valuable things. However, we made it as good as we can so that our guest can feel secure, maintain privacy and more. Our neighbours are truly angels to comfy them, and we could see and feel the excitement in the eyes of our naighbours and guest, we felt amazing.
        In this journey, we have lost many, the location was outstanding, the views was outstanding, the homestay, host, rooms, food, everything was outstanding but the travelling route was the bone in a neck, but recently, with good political power and workers, we are able to receive a good highway that connect our homestay, isn't it great? The roads are now good too. hurrah!! <br>
        Who are we? We are just simple farmers, producers and loyal villagers, we are from the womb of Mother Kurseong, we plant, we grow, we supply. We are as simple as good Indians, We are responsible citizens, We are Indians. We greet our guest, we understand "atithi deva bhava" we adore it and we serve good. We don't have classic background but we are classic, we are not royal but we are humble. We are defination of our guest, we are from Mamring."
